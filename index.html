    <h1> Beach Day </h1>
        
      <p> Beach Day is a fun little animation that resembles the classic beach day. However, the sand appears more abstract to imitate how unique and creative one's imagination can be at the beach. I was inspired to create this because my favorite memories are from the beach. </p>
